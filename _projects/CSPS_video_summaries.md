## Summaries of Canada School of Public Service videos
  
Welcome! Below you will find concise summaries of the highlights and insights from long videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SchoolEcole_GC" target="_blank">Canada School of Public Service</a>. Designed for busy public servants, the summaries generated by NotebookLM allow you to quickly capture key insights from the School's fantastic educational content. Whether you're looking to enhance your skills or stay updated with the latest public service trends without spending hours watching videos, this page ensures you get the information you need, fast and efficiently.

Although I am a public servant myself, please note that I am not affiliated with the School, and the summaries are independently created and not officially sanctioned by the Canada School of Public Service.
